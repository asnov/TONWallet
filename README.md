# TONWallet
TON Wallet Challenge: the contest for Android, iOS, and desktop developers will last until 22 May 18:00 UTC.

## Project Title
TONPay  for TON Wallet Challenge 

## Project Description
TONPay is a mobile wallet app for TON cryptocurrency developed as part of the TON Wallet Challenge.
With our app you can:
* create a new wallet, 
* import an existing one using your seed-phrase, 
* send TON-coin
* receive TON-coin 
* see your wallet balance 
* see transaction list with date, time, sender and commission. 
* View detailed information about each transaction.
* The app generates a QR code with a wallet number that can be sent to request coins
* from the wallet you can be redirected to www.tonscan.org and see details of any of your transactions


## Our advantages:
* Pixel perfect design
* Multiplatform
* User-friendly

We paid a lot of attention to the design and tried to match the markup down to the pixel.
Pay attention to the key import page. When scrolling, the title of the page becomes the heading (header) and the header becomes higher than the rest of the page, exactly as required by the design.

Also, in accordance with the design, all animated icons are inserted, which brings the application to life.

We also thought about the convenience of users - when importing a seed wallet, the phrase can be inserted completely, or if some of the words have already been entered, you can fill in the missing words from the clipboard. 
You can copy the wallet number to the clipboard from Main page.


### Our shortcomings:
at the moment of application, not all features have been completed.
